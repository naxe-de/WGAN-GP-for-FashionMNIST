##Summary

The goal of this project was to train a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) with the FashionMNIST repository by Zalando Research. The WGAN code is based on the coursera.org course on Generative Adverserial Networks by deeplearning.ai with some modifications to fit the purpose.

##Data

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images and consistis of two sets of 60,000 and 10,000 examples (train and test). Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image. In this project I use the whole training set including all classes (T-shirts/tops, Trousers, Pullovers, Dresses, Coats, Sandals, Shirts, Sneakers, Bags and Ankle boots)
